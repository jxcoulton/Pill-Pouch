# Medication Management
A medical profile to keep track of medications and medical history. Many people don't realize how important it is to have this information available to medical professionals in case of an emergency. Being able to keep accurate records and print a copy to keep with you can help a lot in a crisis.

# Future plans 
- medication directions
- text reminders to take medications
- list immunizations with dates
- add medications to a list to view interactions (without being logged in)
